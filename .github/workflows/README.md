## Workflows

### MemBrowse

[MemBrowse](https://membrowse.com/public/ch32-community/arduino_core_ch32) is a handy tool to track changes in used flash/ram memory as result of a PR.
- For each board the i2c_scanner example is used as basis for the report.
- To add new boards or variants, edit the targets configuration: /.github/membrowse-targets.json
- As `target_name` use  board family name (e.g. `ch32v20x`) or variant name (eg. `ch32vm00x-v002`)
- When using a variant, make sure to include the pnum in the fqbn parameter of the `build_cmd`: `--fqbn ch32-community:ch32v:CH32VM00X_EVT:pnum=CH32V002F4,dbg=enable_sym`

### Autmatic build of examples 

As of PR #69, we can now test specific variants:
- Build step compile_examples.yml builds the V006K8 and V002F4 variants as specified.
- It gave build errors only for V002F4 when the sketch was too large
- It skipped the example for that variant after adding a .CH32VM00X-CH32V002F4.test.skip file.

We can still test the default variant per board like before, but now we can also build a specific variant:
Marker in the example directory | Effect
-- | --
.CH32VM00X.test.skip | Skip all configured VM00X variants
.CH32VM00X-CH32V002F4.test.skip | Skip only the V002F4 build
.CH32VM00X.test.only | Allow all configured VM00X variants
.CH32VM00X-CH32V006K8.test.only | Allow only the V006K8 build

The same names work as individual lines in `.skip.txt`. For any example to skip, add this line to its `.skip.txt`:
- `CH32VM00X-CH32V002F4`
